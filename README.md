# PR3 Server
A simple program that allows you to host your own 3 server. A modded version of the game that allows you to connect to user-specified IP/port combinations has been included in the "client" directory.

At the moment, you can create accounts and sort of log into your servers, but that's about it. This software is in its very early stages and is thus far from being usable.

This currently uses an even older version of my server base than the PR1 server. If I ever get around to finishing the new version, I'll probably update this too.
